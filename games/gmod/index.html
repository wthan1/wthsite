        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3144847212">plugs and sockets</a><br>
        plug things, socket things, and anything inbetween. now supports wiremod!<br>
        was stuck in ffvjunk for a long time. making it duplicator compatible took over 90% of the time spent making this addon<br>

        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3138667896">observation bot</a><br>
        an empty headed little* barrel boy who wanders around and looks for things to take pictures of<br>
        robots are cool. this was the first npc ive made, and more robots will probably come<br><br>
        *he isnt really that little. kinda oppresive actually<br>

        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3125506224">huge hand saw</a><br>
        a conglomeration of props that make up this scary looking saw thing<br>
        primary fire spins up the saw, doing rapid damage to whatever youre looking at<br>
        secondary fire launches the saw, the speed it gets launched out at depends on how quick its spinning so make sure youre revved up before you shoot<br>
        this was made to test out swep construction kit but turned out to be a lot of fun to use<br>

        this is my favorite addon that ive made<br>
        a harpoon that you can throw, when it hits a wall itll stick into it or if it hits a prop itll weld onto it<br>
        it can also impale npcs and stick them to walls or props, as seen in the image below<br>

        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3120512065">quick alignment</a><br>
        another utility addon, a recreation of the easy alignment tool before it seemed to disappear from the workshop one day<br>
        an stool that will align props together on any combination of the x, y, and z axes<br>
        <img src="quickalignment.png" title="the stool menu on this is so much better than the easy alignment tool one, it really sucked"><br>

        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3118067999">quick visibility</a><br>
        option in the context menu that lets you toggle the visibility of whatever<br>
        functionally does the exact same thing as getting out the color tool and putting transparency all the way down, just a lot more convenient<br>

        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3116352433">industrial shredder</a><br>
        shreds most anything you could put in it. best with props, worst with ragdolls<br>

        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3112732133">live grenade</a><br>
        zombine swep<br>
        you cant throw it or even holster it, and after 3 seconds it explodes like a normal grenade<br>
        its not a well written addon but i like it its funny<br>

        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3111241376">skelifier</a><br>
        unlike shadow hunt which was a complete flop, this addon got really popular and made it to the front page! 
        despite that, it sucks.<br>
        its a stool and thing in the context menu that will skelify some npcs and ragdolls by deleting them and spawning a skeleton ragdoll in the exact same pose, "inspired" by the thing in entropy zero 2 that does the exact same thing but better<br>
        also, first yellow border icon<br>

        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3101731578">shadow hunt</a><br>
        the first addon i published to the workshop, and the most ambitious until observation bot... whoops<br>
        a gamemode where each round 1 person is picked as the shadow and the rest are survivors, the shadow tries to kill the survivors while the survivors try to survive until the round ends. more information on the steam page<br>
