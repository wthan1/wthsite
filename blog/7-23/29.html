    hello<br>
    first entry. i dont know if ill keep this part of the website, but if i do itll probably be updated really sparsely. the main point of this page if it stays up is to be able to look back at it in the future and see what was going on<br>
    anyways. ive been working on a game i call capflinger for a bit and it was nearly finished but im not going to touch it for a while. it was the most ambitious thing ive ever made in godot so far and the inner workings of it are such a mess. there are lots of scripts that are all split up and do things that would be better somewhere else, and its not just bad practice it made it such a pain trying to add stuff. near the end i started making stuff much better and easy to add to, but most of it was bad. i was pushing through though, and i think i couldve finished it, but i realized that it just isnt fun to play. it was really disheartening. to make it fun to play id have to overhaul how the game plays and with the spaghetti code it would just need a full rewrite. maybe one day, not today. or soon. even though it was overall sort of a flop i think i really did learn a lot about how i should go about making my next game. ill try to write another post for when the next one is done, hopefully its actually finished
