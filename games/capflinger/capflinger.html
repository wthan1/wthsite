    team up with lass of Dell and Purple Joe: Blinkers Paradox to annoy her boss by pelting him with bottlecaps and ruining his day<br>
    careful to not let lass get too excited or she could give you away to pj, but if she gets bored then there isnt much point to keep going<br><br>
    controls:<br>
    left mouse to pick up cap or shush lass<br>
    when a cap is in hand, hold left click to prime it and move your mouse up and down to adjust arc<br>
    scroll wheel to adjust sensitivity<br>
    escape to enter menu<br><br>
    characters and art by brack (thanks!)<br>
